# **App Name**: Firebase Uploader

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allows users to upload images by dragging and dropping or selecting files from their device.
- Firebase Storage Integration: Integrates with Firebase Storage to store uploaded images securely in the cloud.
- URL Generation: Generates a direct URL for each uploaded image, which can be shared and used in various platforms.
- Link Display: Displays generated image links in URL, BBCode, and HTML formats for easy copying and pasting.
- Copy to Clipboard: Provides buttons to copy the generated URL, BBCode, or HTML code to the clipboard.
- Filename Customization: Lets users set custom filenames (optional) for uploaded images to avoid collisions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0CFEC) to create a calm and trustworthy atmosphere.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), nearly white, to provide a clean and uncluttered backdrop that keeps the focus on content.
- Accent color: Pale, warm grey (#C0C0C0). This acts as a gentle, neutral complement to the analogous primary color.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text to ensure modern, clear readability.  
- Use simple, outlined icons for upload, copy, and other actions.
- Center the content on the page with a maximum width for better readability.
- Use subtle progress bar animations during the upload process to provide visual feedback.
